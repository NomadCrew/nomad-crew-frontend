# Project Brief: NomadCrew Frontend

## 1. Project Name
NomadCrew Frontend

## 2. Project Mission & Vision
To create a best-in-class mobile application for the NomadCrew platform, enabling users to seamlessly plan, manage, and experience group travel. The application aims to be intuitive, reliable, performant, and a delightful companion for nomads and group travelers.

## 3. Core Problem Statement
Group travel coordination is complex, involving communication, planning, expense tracking, and real-time updates. Existing tools are often fragmented. NomadCrew aims to provide a unified, mobile-first solution.

## 4. Target Audience
- Digital nomads
- Groups of friends traveling together
- Families on vacation
- Corporate teams on retreats
- Anyone organizing or participating in group trips

## 5. Project Scope
The frontend application will cover features including (but not limited to):
- User authentication (Supabase: email/password, social logins)
- Trip creation and management
- Itinerary planning
- Real-time chat per trip
- Shared to-do lists per trip
- Expense tracking and splitting (future)
- Location sharing and tracking (optional, per trip)
- Notifications (in-app and push)
- User profiles and settings
- Onboarding for new users

**Current Status (as of Refactoring Guide):** The application is in active development. A comprehensive refactoring initiative is underway to elevate the codebase to a production-grade standard, focusing on modularity (feature-first architecture), maintainability (SOLID principles, design patterns), performance, and comprehensive testing.

## 6. Key Goals & Success Metrics
- **Stability & Reliability:** Minimize crashes, ensure data integrity.
- **Performance:** Fast load times, smooth animations, responsive UI.
- **User Experience:** Intuitive navigation, aesthetically pleasing design, ease of use.
- **Maintainability:** Clean, well-structured, documented code that is easy to understand and modify.
- **Scalability:** Architecture that supports adding new features and handling more users efficiently.
- **Test Coverage:** High test coverage to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

## 7. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for initial production, may be future)
- Offline-first full functionality (basic caching for offline viewing is in scope, but full offline editing and sync is a later phase).
- Advanced AI planning features.
- Desktop web application (focus is mobile-first with Expo).

## 8. Stakeholders
- NomadCrew Product Team
- Development Team (Frontend & Backend)
- Consultant (provided the refactoring guide)
- Future Users
