## ðŸŽ¯ What's Left (Pending Tasks)

### Phase 1: Foundational Refactoring
1.  **Project Structure Refactor:**
    *   [x] Transition to a feature-first directory structure (`src/features/...`).
        *   [x] Create `src/features` and `src/navigation` directories.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Moved to `src/features/auth/` (Completed).
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** `service.ts` created; `supabaseClient` & `secure-token-manager` integrated.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** `store.ts` (full content) moved & `supabaseClient` import updated.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Direct Supabase calls in `store.ts` abstracted to `service.ts` methods.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Auth-specific types moved to `src/features/auth/types.ts`; old global type file deleted.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Codebase imports for `useAuthStore` and `supabaseClient` updated.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Refactored API calls in `store.ts` (e.g., `registerPushToken`) into `AuthService`.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Reviewed `registerAuthHandlers` in `store.ts` (current approach acceptable).
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Finalized `types.ts` (removed redundant custom `Session`).
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Verified `src/store` and `src/types` not empty.
        *   [x] **Trips Module:** Moved to `src/features/trips/` (Completed).
        *   [x] **Todos Module:** Moved to `src/features/todos/` (Completed: store, types, components moved; imports updated; old files deleted).
        *   [x] **Chat Module:** Moved to `src/features/chat/` (Completed).
        *   [x] **Location Module:** Plan and move `src/store/useLocationStore.ts` and related files to `src/features/location/`. (Completed: store, types, components, screens moved; imports updated; old files/dirs cleaned up).
        *   [x] **Notifications Module:** Plan and move to `src/features/notifications/`. (Completed: store, types, components, hooks moved; imports updated; old files/dirs cleaned up).

        *   [x] **Refactor Existing Barrel Files:** Updated imports from `auth` and `chat` feature barrel files to use direct paths, then delete the barrel files. (Trips module was created without one, adhering to new rule).
        *   [x] **Post-Refactor Stability Check:** Addressed lint errors after `trips` module refactor. Lint passes with 0 errors.
        *   [x] **WebSocket Event Handling Fix:** Corrected event parsing and routing in `TripDetailScreen.tsx`. Lint passes with 0 errors.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Code cleanup (removed SecureTokenManager, secure-unlimited-store) and API client integration (`registerAuthHandlers`) completed.
    *   [x] Organize `app/` (Expo Router) to mirror feature groupings.
        *   [x] Cleaned up obsolete files: Removed `app/(tabs)-bkp/` directory.

2.  [x] **Address Codebase Comments:**
    *   [x] Systematically reviewed and addressed `TODO`, `FIXME`, and other relevant comments left in the codebase from previous refactoring efforts.
    *   [x] Moved `getUserDisplayName` from trips store to a proper utility file in auth feature.

    *   [x] Removed and documented the deprecated DateSeparator logic in ChatList component.
3.  **Backend: Push Token Deregistration Endpoint:**
    *   (Backend Task) Implement the backend endpoint (e.g., `/users/push-token/deregister`) that the `logout` function in `useAuthStore` calls.
4.  **Thorough Testing & Validation (Authentication):**
    *   Test all authentication flows: email/password (login, register), Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In.
    *   Verify token persistence in SecureStore and correct behavior across app restarts.
    *   Test `onAuthStateChange` listener scenarios.
    *   Confirm 401 interceptor correctly refreshes token and retries requests.
    *   Test logout thoroughly: SecureStore cleared, push token deregistered (verify backend), state reset.
    *   Test error handling for all auth operations.
