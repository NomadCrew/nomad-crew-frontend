# Project Progress

- Initial setup of memory bank files.
- Received and processed the comprehensive refactoring guide.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Left (Pending Tasks)

### Phase 1: Foundational Refactoring
1.  **Project Structure Refactor:**
    *   [x] Transition to a feature-first directory structure (`src/features/...`).
        *   [x] Create `src/features` and `src/navigation` directories.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Moved to `src/features/auth/` (Completed).
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** `service.ts` created; `supabaseClient` & `secure-token-manager` integrated.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** `store.ts` (full content) moved & `supabaseClient` import updated.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Direct Supabase calls in `store.ts` abstracted to `service.ts` methods.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Auth-specific types moved to `src/features/auth/types.ts`; old global type file deleted.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Codebase imports for `useAuthStore` and `supabaseClient` updated.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Refactored API calls in `store.ts` (e.g., `registerPushToken`) into `AuthService`.
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Reviewed `registerAuthHandlers` in `store.ts` (current approach acceptable).
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Finalized `types.ts` (removed redundant custom `Session`).
        *   [x] **Auth Module:** Verified `src/store` and `src/types` not empty.
        *   [x] **Trips Module:** Moved to `src/features/trips/` (Completed).
        *   [x] **Todos Module:** Moved to `src/features/todos/` (Completed: store, types, components moved; imports updated; old files deleted).
        *   [ ] **Chat Module:** Plan and move to `src/features/chat/`.
        *   [ ] **Location Module:** Plan and move to `src/features/location/` (or determine if it's a shared concern).
        *   [ ] **Notifications Module:** Plan and move to `src/features/notifications/`.
        *   [x] **Refactor Existing Barrel Files:** Updated imports from `auth` and `chat` feature barrel files to use direct paths, then delete the barrel files. (Trips module was created without one, adhering to new rule).
        *   [x] **Post-Refactor Stability Check:** Addressed lint errors after `trips` module refactor. Lint passes with 0 errors.
    *   [ ] Organize `app/` (Expo Router) to mirror feature groupings.
    *   [ ] Clean up obsolete files (e.g., `app/(tabs)-bkp/`, `TestScreen`).
2.  **Coding Standards & Tooling Setup:**
    *   [ ] Customize and enforce ESLint rules strictly.
    *   [ ] Integrate and configure Prettier for code formatting.
    *   [ ] Set up Git hooks (Husky) for pre-commit/pre-push checks.
3.  **Navigation System Refinement (Expo Router):**
    *   [ ] Consolidate routing with a proper root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`) including global providers.
    *   [ ] Implement tab and stack navigation structure.
    *   [ ] Ensure deep linking configuration is robust.
    *   [ ] Implement guarded routes for authentication.
    *   [ ] Remove redundant navigation code.

### Phase 2: Core Logic & Pattern Implementation
4.  **SOLID Principles Implementation (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Refactor key components/hooks for SRP (e.g., `ChatScreen` -> `useChatSession`).
    *   [ ] Ensure Open/Closed principle.
    *   [ ] Apply Liskov Substitution & Interface Segregation.
    *   [ ] Implement Dependency Inversion (e.g., stores & services).
5.  **State Management (Zustand) Enhancements (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Implement selective state selection using selectors.
    *   [ ] Refactor stores to use a dedicated service layer.
    *   [ ] Standardize persistence with `persist` middleware.
    *   [ ] Introduce derived state/selector functions.
6.  **Design Patterns Adoption (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Implement Container/Presenter pattern.
    *   [ ] Expand service abstraction layer.
    *   [ ] Organize and create new custom hooks.
    *   [x] Use barrel files (`index.ts`) - **Reverted: Rule is NO barrel files for internal app code.**

### Phase 3: Feature-Specific Refactoring
7.  **Feature Module Refactoring (Chat - DONE, covered by Phase 1)**
8.  **Feature Module Refactoring (Trips - DONE, covered by Phase 1)**
9.  **(Placeholder for other features: Todos, Notifications, Location etc.)**
    *   [ ] Apply similar refactoring to other feature modules.

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Optimization
10. **Performance Optimization (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Refactor lists to use FlashList.
    *   [ ] Implement pagination, windowing, memoization.
    *   [ ] Optimize assets, explore lazy loading.
11. **Testing Strategy Implementation (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for utils/services.
    *   [ ] Develop store tests for Zustand logic.
    *   [ ] Implement component tests (RNTL).
    *   [ ] Create integration tests (MSW).
    *   [ ] Set up E2E tests (Detox).
12. **TypeScript & Typing Enhancements (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Achieve full type coverage, eliminate `any`.
    *   [ ] Enforce strict linting for types.
    *   [ ] Migrate any remaining JS code to TS.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Final Review
13. **Documentation Update:**
    *   [ ] Ensure JSDoc/TSDoc comments are comprehensive.
    *   [ ] Update README if necessary to reflect new structure/commands.
14. **Final Review & Cleanup:**
    *   [ ] Review all refactored code against the guide.
    *   [ ] Perform final linting and testing pass.
    *   [ ] Remove any dead code or temporary artifacts.
