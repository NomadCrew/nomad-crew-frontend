# Project Progress

## ðŸš€ What Works (Completed Tasks)

- Initial setup of memory bank files.
- Received and processed the comprehensive refactoring guide.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Left (Pending Tasks)

### Phase 1: Foundational Refactoring
1.  **Project Structure Refactor:**
    *   [~] Transition to a feature-first directory structure (`src/features/...`).
        *   [x] Create `src/features` and `src/navigation` directories.
        *   [x] Move `auth` module files (utils, client) to `src/features/auth/`.
        *   [x] Create `src/features/auth/service.ts` with initial content.
        *   [!] Attempted to move `useAuthStore` to `src/features/auth/store.ts` - **FILE INCOMPLETE, AUTH BROKEN**.
        *   [ ] **Resolve `src/features/auth/store.ts` incompleteness.**
        *   [ ] Abstract Supabase calls from `auth/store.ts` to `auth/service.ts`.
        *   [ ] Create `src/features/auth/types.ts` & `index.ts`.
        *   [ ] Update codebase imports for `useAuthStore`.
        *   [ ] Move `chat` module to `src/features/chat/` & refactor.
        *   [ ] Move `trips` module to `src/features/trips/` & refactor.
        *   [ ] Move `todos` module to `src/features/todos/` & refactor.
        *   [ ] Move `notifications` module to `src/features/notifications/` & refactor.
        *   [ ] Consolidate global directories (`components`, `hooks`, `services`, `store`, `types`, `utils`) under `src/`.
    *   [ ] Organize `app/` (Expo Router) to mirror feature groupings.
    *   [ ] Clean up obsolete files (e.g., `app/(tabs)-bkp/`, `TestScreen`).
2.  **Coding Standards & Tooling Setup:**
    *   [ ] Customize and enforce ESLint rules strictly.
    *   [ ] Integrate and configure Prettier for code formatting.
    *   [ ] Set up Git hooks (Husky) for pre-commit/pre-push checks.
3.  **Navigation System Refinement (Expo Router):**
    *   [ ] Consolidate routing with a proper root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`) including global providers.
    *   [ ] Implement tab and stack navigation structure.
    *   [ ] Ensure deep linking configuration is robust.
    *   [ ] Implement guarded routes for authentication.
    *   [ ] Remove redundant navigation code.

### Phase 2: Core Logic & Pattern Implementation
4.  **SOLID Principles Implementation (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Refactor key components/hooks for SRP (e.g., `ChatScreen` -> `useChatSession`).
    *   [ ] Ensure Open/Closed principle.
    *   [ ] Apply Liskov Substitution & Interface Segregation.
    *   [ ] Implement Dependency Inversion (e.g., stores & services).
5.  **State Management (Zustand) Enhancements (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Implement selective state selection using selectors.
    *   [ ] Refactor stores to use a dedicated service layer.
    *   [ ] Standardize persistence with `persist` middleware.
    *   [ ] Introduce derived state/selector functions.
6.  **Design Patterns Adoption (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Implement Container/Presenter pattern.
    *   [ ] Expand service abstraction layer.
    *   [ ] Organize and create new custom hooks.
    *   [ ] Use barrel files (`index.ts`).

### Phase 3: Feature-Specific Refactoring
7.  **Feature Module Refactoring (Chat):**
    *   [ ] Restructure Chat module into `src/features/chat/`.
    *   [ ] Refactor `useChatStore`.
    *   [ ] Improve Chat components.
8.  **Feature Module Refactoring (Trips):**
    *   [ ] Restructure Trip module into `src/features/trips/`.
    *   [ ] Refactor `CreateTripModal`.
    *   [ ] Improve `useTripStore`.
9.  **(Placeholder for other features: Todos, Notifications, etc.)**
    *   [ ] Apply similar refactoring to other feature modules.

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Optimization
10. **Performance Optimization (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Refactor lists to use FlashList.
    *   [ ] Implement pagination, windowing, memoization.
    *   [ ] Optimize assets, explore lazy loading.
11. **Testing Strategy Implementation (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for utils/services.
    *   [ ] Develop store tests for Zustand logic.
    *   [ ] Implement component tests (RNTL).
    *   [ ] Create integration tests (MSW).
    *   [ ] Set up E2E tests (Detox).
12. **TypeScript & Typing Enhancements (Iterative):**
    *   [ ] Achieve full type coverage, eliminate `any`.
    *   [ ] Enforce strict linting for types.
    *   [ ] Migrate any remaining JS code to TS.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Final Review
13. **Documentation Update:**
    *   [ ] Ensure JSDoc/TSDoc comments are comprehensive.
    *   [ ] Update README if necessary to reflect new structure/commands.
14. **Final Review & Cleanup:**
    *   [ ] Review all refactored code against the guide.
    *   [ ] Perform final linting and testing pass.
    *   [ ] Remove any dead code or temporary artifacts.
