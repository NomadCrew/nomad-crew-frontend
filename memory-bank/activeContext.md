## üß† Next Steps

1.  **~~Chat Module Refactor: Plan and execute refactoring for the chat module into `src/features/chat/`.~~ (DONE - Covered previously)**
2.  **Project Structure Refactor (Ongoing):**
    *   **~~Next Feature: Identify and move the `todos` module to `src/features/todos/`.~~ (DONE)**
    *   **Next Feature:** Identify and move the `location` store (`src/store/useLocationStore.ts`) and related components/screens (e.g., `app/location/`, `components/location/`) to `src/features/location/`. Refactor its internal structure (store, types, components, services if applicable).
    *   Follow with the `notifications` module (`src/store/useNotificationStore.ts`, `src/components/notifications/`, etc.).
    *   Consolidate global directories (`components`, `hooks`, `services`, `store`, `types`, `utils`) under `src/`, ensuring they only contain truly shared, non-feature-specific code.
    *   Organize `app/` (Expo Router) to mirror feature groupings.
    *   Clean up obsolete files (e.g., `app/(tabs)-bkp/`, `TestScreen`).
3.  **Verify Application Build & Run (Post-Refactor):** After all major refactoring (including Location and Notifications), perform a full build and run the application on a device/emulator to ensure stability and catch any runtime errors introduced by the refactoring.
4.  **Address Lint Warnings:** Systematically go through the remaining lint warnings and fix them.
5.  **SOLID Principles Implementation (Post-Structure Refactor):**
    *   Begin applying SOLID principles systematically to the newly structured feature modules.
6.  **State Management Refinement (Zustand):**
    *   Review all Zustand stores after they are moved into their respective feature folders.
7.  **Navigation System Refinement (Expo Router).**
8.  **Component Refactoring & UI System.**
9.  **API Service Layer & Data Fetching.**
10. **Performance Optimization.**
11. **Testing Strategy.**
12. **Coding Standards & Tooling Setup.**


## ‚ùó Active Decisions / Context

-   The refactor is following the feature-first structure outlined in the provided guide.
-   Modules are moved, then internal structures refactored, then imports updated.
-   **Rule: No Barrel Files for Application Imports.** Internal application imports must be direct.
-   `useTodoStore` and `useLocationStore` are still in `src/store/` as their respective features haven't been refactored yet. Their imports in other features point to the old paths for now.
