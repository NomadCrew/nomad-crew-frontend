# Active Context

## âœ… Recent Changes

- **Implemented Authentication System:**
  - Implemented `AuthGuard` component for route protection based on authentication status
  - Created `AuthProvider` to manage auth state and deep linking for authentication flows
  - Added token refresh mechanism and proper redirection based on auth status
  - Integrated auth guards into the app's root layout for comprehensive protection

## ðŸ§  Next Steps

1. Test the authentication system:
   - Verify auth guards redirect unauthenticated users to login
   - Test session refresh mechanism
   - Validate deep linking for auth callbacks (OAuth, email verification)
   - Test user session persistence across app restarts

2. Enhance authentication user experience:
   - Add clear error handling and user feedback for authentication failures
   - Create Toast/Alert components for auth errors
   - Improve error messages and recovery options

3. Complete testing of the application on device/emulator to verify authentication guards and routing are working properly.

4. Refine the deep linking implementation for authentication flows:
   - Test the auth/callback handling for OAuth and email verification
   - Add support for additional authentication scenarios (password reset, invitation acceptance)

5. Continue with Phase 2 of the refactoring plan: Core Logic & Pattern Implementation.
